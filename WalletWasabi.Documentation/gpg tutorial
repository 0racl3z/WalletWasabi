First, you need nopara73 fingerprint. 

Open your terminal and type:

gpg --recv-keys 21D7CA45565DBCCEBE45115DB4B72266C47E075E
 
Or save from: https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/PGP.txt as nopara73.asc

Go back to Wasabi website (https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) and download WasabiLinux-X.X.X.tar.gz and its signature WasabiLinux-X.X.X.tar.gz.asc
 
Copy all the 3 files to the same folder, open the terminal and use command 'cd' to navigate to that folder or right click on the folder and select "Open in Terminal" and run these commands.
 
gpg --import nopara73.asc
  
gpg --verify WasabiLinux-X.X.X.tar.gz.asc WasabiLinux-X.X.X.tar.gz
 
If the message returned says Good signature and that it was signed by Ficsór Ádám with a Primary key fingerprint: 21D7 CA45 565D BCCE BE45  115D B4B7 2266 C47E 075E, then the software is authentic.
 
Remember to check again the pgp signature every time you make a new download.
