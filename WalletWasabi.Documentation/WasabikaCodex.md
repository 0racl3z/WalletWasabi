## Code review (CR)

- Read the description of the Pull Request. If it is missing ask for it if necessary.
- Check Continuous Integration (CI) before code review. Only continue if it is passed.
- Do not review code longer than 60 minutes or more than 400 lines. Take a 10 minute pause at that point.
- Check for code smells. Give constructive feedback that helps (Not hurts).
  - Easy to read.
  - Maintainability.
- Checkout PR and test it if required.
- Request changes if needed.
- Approve if you are done.

__Tips__: if the PR is too big ask for breakdown.

__Fact__: code review is the top rated code improvement tool. It is the only one scientifically proven methodology to improve code quality.
